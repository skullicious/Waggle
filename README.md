# Waggle
My attempt at a complete business solution.. Beginning with the business layer in C# and SQL server back end..

Initial Upload...

Currently working on tidying results from dataReader (double quotes trailing single quotes and whitespace)..Not sure if I need to try to fix this in the dummy DB or as part of the dataReader process.

Need to develop Product workflow more..Add a friendly product tracking system that is maybe dynamically built based on manufacturer, product and size!? 

Need to figure out the best way of unit testing methods that work on live data/connections such as SQL.

Might put in very basic front end to keep me sane and give me a some feedback other than test methods.
